Despite the fact I‚Äôve returned to the 2008 original several times over the years and found it to hold up fairly well, my latest journey through the darkened hallways of the USG Ishimura still managed to consistently surprise me and pull me into Isaac‚Äôs plight far more than ever before, while still satisfying my desire to butcher undead astronauts with an enjoyable arsenal of wildly unsafe mining tools. It‚Äôs clear that this superb Dead Space remake has been a labour of love for the team at Motive Studios, who‚Äôve very carefully balanced innovation and renovation with preservation, and to their credit the end result is undoubtedly the definitive way to experience ‚Äì or re-experience ‚Äì one of the best survival horror shooters that Capcom never made.\"",
